# NK_Blackjack_Game_Java_CS161
--Nate Kloempken -- University of Puget Sound -- Fall 2018

This Java code uses a canvas object to draw a game of blackjack in a window. It is a simple implementation of the game, but was a large project at the end of my first CS class.

There are possibly a few bugs in the game that I could not pin down at the time of making this project.  Having a more limited knowledge base, and a lack of experience made
it a challenge to fix everything, but in the end it was a working game and I was happy about it.  I wish I could redo it knowing what I do now to make it so much more efficient, while
also avoiding any bugs that were left in the pproject.  

Still, this project was my first real coding project that went beyond String manipulation, so it was a big moment for me in knowing that coding is what I wanted to do.
